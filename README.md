**Note**
This project was simply used to confirm my understanding of the Context API within React. This is an area where I had trouble with fully grasping the concept and so I decided to construct a new website and encorporate this feature. 
Admittedly, it was very challenging and I constantly found myself relying on YouTube tutorials to complete that aspect of the build, but it was definitely rewarding in the sense that my understanding developed by completing this build.

Here, props were used to pass down data to the card components. This is something that I am very comfortable with. Now, the site does is not mobile-friendly as of yet, but I will be continuing the build as I hope to add a complete backend for it and also allow dummy purchases via stripe js.
