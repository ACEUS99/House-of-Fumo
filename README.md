# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The technologies used in this project were HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Google Firebase


**Note**
This project was simply used to confirm my understanding of the Context API within React. This is an area where I have trouble with fully grasping the concept and so I decided to construct a new website and encorporatge this feature. 
Admittedly, it was very challenging and I constantly found myself relying on YouTube tutorials to complete that aspect of the build.
